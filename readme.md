A robit that makes other robits afraid to be robits.

Yes, this is very naive async code. On the one hand, I'm not interested in
over-optimizing it; on the other hand, I'm actually in part learning as I go
along. I don't want to hear about it for now; everyone has to make their own
mistakes to learn from.
