This is here to fulfill my legal obligation under the MIT license, as you might
imagine. The actual work in this repo - which is to say my work - as of this
writing - is without a license.

I don't think my changes are likely to be helpful upstream, but I'm open to
requests from the upstream project to fork and pull if they see value.

Speaking of, the code commit starts with the version pointed to there and then
can be tracked back via git history to see the changes I've made.

Regardless, enjoy.
